        Monthly sales trends are analyzed using time-series data.
        Sales are grouped by categories to provide insights into the most profitable product types.

   Predictive Modeling:
        A linear regression model is trained to forecast future sales trends.
        The system evaluates model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

   Visualization:
        Line charts visualize actual sales and forecasts.
        Pie charts represent sales distribution by category.

   API Integration:
        Flask-based APIs allow external users to request sales analysis or forecasts.
        The system leverages OpenAI GPT to generate textual insights about sales trends.
